 If a total of 33 MHz of bandwidth is allocated to a particular FDD cellular 
telephone system which uses two 25 kHz simplex channels to provide full duplex voice and 
control channels, compute the number of channels available per cell if a system uses- 
 
(a)  4-cell reuse.  (b) 7-cell reuse.  (c) 12-cell reuse. 
 If 1 MHz of the allocated spectrum is dedicated to control channels, determine an equitable 
distribution of control channels and voice channels in each cell for each of the three systems. 
 
Solution: 
Have given, 
Total bandwidth                               = 33 MHz, 
             = 33,000 kHz 
Channel bandwidth           = 25 kHz x 2 simplex channels 
                  = 50 kHz / duplex channel  
Total available channels          = Total Bandwidth / Channel Bandwidth 
              = 33,000 / 50 
                     = 660 channels 
If 1 MHz of the allocated spectrum is dedicated to control channels, 
 i.e. Control channel bandwidth           = 1000 kHz 
The number of available control channel    = Control channel bandwidth / Channel bandwidth 
              = 1000 / 50 
              = 20 channels 
(a) 
Have given,  
Cluster size, N = 4 
 
Total number of channels available per cell   = Total available channels / N 
     = 660/4  
     ≈165 channels.  
∴ Equitable distribution of, 
Voice Channel      = (Total available channels - The number of available control channel) / N 
               = (660 – 20) / 4 
         ≈ 160 channels   
Control Channel  = Total number of channels available per cell – Voice Channel 
         = 165 – 160 
         = 5 channels 
 
 
 
 
(b) 
Have given,  
Cluster size, N = 7 
 
Total number of channels available per cell   = Total available channels / N 
     = 660/7 
     ≈94 channels.  
∴ Equitable distribution of, 
Voice Channel      = (Total available channels - The number of available control channel) / N 
               = (660 – 20) / 7 
         ≈ 91 channels   
Control Channel  = Total number of channels available per cell – Voice Channel 
         = 94 – 91 
         = 3 channels 
 
(c) 
Have given,  
Cluster size, N = 12 
 
Total number of channels available per cell   = Total available channels / N 
     = 660/12 
     ≈ 55 channels.  
∴ Equitable distribution of, 
Voice Channel      = (Total available channels - The number of available control channel) / N 
               = (660 – 20) / 12 
         ≈ 53 channels   
Control Channel  = Total number of channels available per cell – Voice Channel 
         = 55 – 53 
         = 2 channels

: If a signal to interference ratio of 15 dB is required for satisfactory forward 
channel performance of a cellular system, what is the frequency reuse factor and cluster size 
that should be used for maximum capacity if the path loss exponent is- 
(a) n = 4.    
(b) n = 3. 
Assume that there are 6 co-channels cells in the first tier and all of them are at the same 
distance from the mobile. Use suitable approximations. 


Solution: 
Have given, 
Minimum Required Signal-to-Noise interference ratio, S/I   = 15 dB, 
The number of Co-channel interfering cells, io                      
We Know, 
= 6 
Number of cell reuse, N = i2 + i*j + j2  ……………………………………………. (i) 
First, let us consider a 7-cell reuse pattern, N = 7    
For i=1, j=2 
Also,  
Where,  
(a) 
The Frequency Reuse Factor, Q = D/R  
= √(3𝑁) ……………..………………………… (ii) 
= 4.583.  
D = Distance between centers of the nearest Co-channel cells. 
R = Radius of the cell. 
Have given,  
Path Loss exponent, n            
= 4 
Frequency Reuse Factor, Q = 4.583. 
We know, 
Signal-to-Noise interference ratio, S/R   = 10 log (Qn / i0 ) 
= 10 log ((4.583)4 / 6)  
= 18.66 dB. 
Since this is greater than the minimum required S/I (18.66 > 15), N = 7 can be used. 
(b) 
Have given,  
Path Loss exponent, n = 3 
We know, 
Signal-to-Noise interference ratio, S/R   = 10 log(Qn / i0 ) ……………….....…. (iii) 
= 10 log ((4.583)3 / 6) 
= 12.05 dB. 
 

 
Since this is less than the minimum required S/I (12.05 < 15), we need to use a larger N. 
Using equation (i), the next possible value of N = 12;  For i = j = 2.  
The corresponding co-channel ratio is given by equation (ii) as- 
Frequency Reuse Factor, Q = 6. 
Using equation (iii) the signal-to-interference ratio, S/I = 15.56 dB.  
Since, this is greater than the minimum required S/I (15.56 > 15), N = 12 can be used.

                   C

From table 3.1, For C = 1 we obtain, A = 0005 
From equation (i), we have- 
Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
= 0.05 users. 
But, actually one user could be supported on one channel. So, U = 1.  

(b) 
Have given,  
Trunked channels,                              
C = 5 
From table 3.1, For C = 5 we obtain, A = 1.13 Erlang. 
From equation (i), we have- 
Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
≈  11 users. 
(c) 
Have given,  
Trunked channels,           
                     C
 = 10 
From table 3.1, For C = 10 we obtain, A = 3.96 Erlang 
From equation (i), we have- 
Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
≈  39 users. 
(d) 
Have given,  
Trunked channels,           
                     C

From table 3.1, For C = 20 we obtain, A = 11.10 Erlang 
From equation (i), we have- 
Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
≈  110 users. 
(e) 
Have given,  
Trunked channels,           
                     C
 = 100 
From table 3.1, For C = 100 we obtain, A = 80.9 Erlang. 
From equation (i), we have- 
Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
≈  809 users.

 An urban area has a population of 2 million residents. Three competing 
trunked mobile networks (systems A, B, and C) provide cellular service in this area. System 
A has 394 cells with 19 channels each, system B has 98 cells with 57 channels each, and 
system C has 49 cells, each with 100 channels. Find the number of users that can be 
supported at 2% blocking if each user averages 2 calls per hour at an average call duration of 
3 minutes. Assuming that all three trunked systems are operated at maximum capacity, 
compute the percentage market penetration of each cellular provider. 

Solution: 
Have given, 
Blocking Probability, PB                                               
= 2%,  
The average number of call requests per unit time 𝜆    = 2. 
The average duration of a call, H                                  
= 3/60 seconds 
There are 2 million residents in the given urban area   = 2000000 
We Know, 
For Erlangs B, Grade of Service, GOS = PB 
= 0.02 
And, Traffic Intensity, Au                                 
Also, Total number of user, U
 Where,

For System-A 
Have given,  
Number of channels per cell used in the system,            
C = 19 
From table 4.1, For C = 19 and GOS = 0.02 we obtain, A = 12 Erlangs 
From equation (i), we have- 
Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
= 120 users. 
Since there are 394 cells, the total number of' subscribers that can be supported by System A 
is equal to 120 x 394 = 47280.  
Since, the percentage market penetration = 47280/2000000 = 2.36% 
For System-B 
Have given,  
Number of channels per cell used in the system,            C = 57

Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
= 450 users. 
Since there are 98 cells, the total number of' subscribers that can be supported by System B 
is equal to 450 x 98 = 44,100.  
Since, the percentage market penetration = 44100/2000000 = 2.205% 
For System-C 
Have given,  
Number of channels per cell used in the system,             C = 100 
From table 4.1, For C = 100 and GOS = 0.02 we obtain, A = 88 Erlangs 
From equation (i), we have- 
Total number of user, U   = A / Au 
= 880 users. 
Since there are 49 cells, the total number of' subscribers that can be supported by System C 
is equal to 880 x 49 = 43,120.  
Since, the percentage market penetration = 43,120/2000000 = 2.156% 
Therefore, total number of cellular subscribers that can be supported by these three systems 
are (47280 + 44100 + 43120) = 134500 users.  
The market penetration of the three systems combined is equal to 134500/2000000 = 6.725

 A certain city has an area of 1,300 square miles and is covered by a cellular 
system using a 7-cell reuse pattern. Each cell has a radius of 4 miles and the city is allocated 
40 MHz of spectrum with a full duplex channel bandwidth of 60 kHz. Assume a GOS of 2% 
for an Erlang B system is specified. If the offered traffic per user is 0.03 Erlangs, compute-  
a) The number of cells in the service area,  
b) The number of channels per cell,  
c) Traffic intensity of each cell,  
d) The maximum carried traffic, 
e) The total number of users that can be served for 2% GOS,  
f) The number of mobiles per channel, and  
g) The theoretical maximum number of users that could be served at one time by the 
system.


Solution: 
(a) 
Have given,  
Total coverage area = 1300 miles 
Cell radius = 4 miles 
We know, 
The area of a cell (hexagon) can be shown to be 2.5981R2 
Thus each cell covers 2.5981 × (4)2 = 41.57 sq km. 
Hence, the total number of cells, Nc = 1300/41.57 = 31 cells 
(b) 
Have given,  
Allocated spectrum                                   
Channel width          
Frequency reuse factor, N         
We know,  
= 40, 000,000 Hz 
= 60,000 Hz 
= 7 cells 
The total number of channels per cell, C  = Allocated spectrum / (Channel width × N) 
= 40, 000,000 / (60,000 ×  7)  
= 95 channels/cell 
(c) 
Have given,  
From (b) No, C  = 95 
And, GOS         
= 0.02  
From the table 4.1 (Erlang B chart) For C = 95 and GOS = 0.02, we have- 
Traffic intensity per cell, A = 84 Erlangs/cell 

(d) 
Have given,  
From (a), Number of cells              
= 31 cells 
From (c), Traffic intensity per cell = 84 Erlangs/cell 
We Know, 
Maximum carried traffic = Number of cells × Traffic intensity per cell  
= 31 × 84 
= 2604 Erlangs.  
(e) 
Have given,  
Traffic per user, Au    
From (d), Total traffic, A          
We Know, 
= 0.03 Erlangs  
= 2604 Erlangs. 
Total number of users, U  = A / Au 
= 2604 / 0.03  
= 86,800 users. 
(f) 
Have given,  
Allocated spectrum                    
Channel width                    
= 40, 000,000 Hz 
= 60,000 Hz 
From (e), Number of users, U    = 86,800 users. 
We Know,     
Number of channels       
= Allocated Spectrum / Channel Width 
= 40, 000,000/60,000 
≈ 666 
Number of mobiles per channel = Number of users/Number of channels 
= 86,800 / 666 
≈ 130 mobiles/channel 
(g) 
Have given,  
From (b) No, C      
= 95 channels/cell 
From (a), the total number of cells, Nc= 31 cells. 
From (e) Total number of users, U      
= 86,800 users. 
We Know, 
The theoretical maximum number of served mobiles is the number of available 
channels in the system (all channels occupied)  
= C × Nc  
= 95  ×  31 = 2945 users

Which is (2945/86,800) × 100 = 3.4% of the customer base

: If a transmitter produces 50 watts of power, express the transmit power in units 
of  
a) dBm,   and b) dBW. 
If 50 watts is applied to a unity gain antenna with a 900 MHz carrier frequency,  
c) Find the received power in dBm at a free space distance of 100 m from the 
antenna,  
d) What is P (10 km)?  
Assume unity gain for the receiver antenna. 


Solution: 
Have given,  
Transmitter power, Pt = 50 W  
Carrier frequency, fc = 900 MHz  
(a) 
We know, 
Transmitter power, Pt(dBm)   = 10 log[Pt(mW)/(1mW)] 
    = 10 log [50 x 103] 
    = 47.0 dBm 
(b) 
We know, 
Transmitter power, Pt(dBW)  = 10 log[Pt(W)/(1W)] 
    = 10 log [50] 
    = 17.0 dBW 
(c) 
If 50 watts is applied to a unity gain antenna with a 900 MHz carrier frequency, 
Have given,  
Transmitter Gain, Gt     = 1 
Receiver Gain, Gr   = 1 
Wave length λ    = c / f = 1 /3 m 
The T-R separation distance, d  = 100m 
The system loss factor, L   = 1 
We know, 
The received power, Pr    = (Pt × Gt ×  Gr × λ2) / (4π2 × d2 × L) 
       = (50 × 1 × 1 × (1/3)2) / ((4π)2 × 1002 × 1) 
       = 3.5 × 10-3 mW 
Received power, Pr(dBm)  = 10 log[Pr(mW)]  
          = 10 log[Pr(3.5 × 10-3)] 
      = -24.5 dBm 

(d) 
Have given,  
do    = 10 km = 10000 m 
We Know, 
The received power at 10 km can be expressed in terms of dBm, we have 
∴ Pr(10 km)  = Pr(100) + 20 log[d / do] 
    = Pr(100) + 20 log[100 / 10000] 
= -24.5 – 40 
= -64.5 dBm

 Determine the path loss of a 900MHz cellular system in a large city from a 
base station with the height of 100m and mobile station installed in a vehicle with antenna 
height of 2m. The distance between mobile and base station is 4 km.

Solution: 
Have given,  
The frequency, fc    
= 900 MHz (150 MHz to 1500MHz) 
The effective transmitter (base station) antenna height, hte   
The effective transmitter (mobile) antenna height, hre   
T-R separation distance, d

Now, The correction factor for effective movile antenna height,  
a(hre) = 3.2 (log 11.75 hre)2 – 4.97 dB for fc ≥ 300 MHz 
From Okumura-Hata Model we know, 
The path loss in urban areas is given by 
= 69.55 + 26.16 × 2.954 – 13.82 × 2 – 1.045 + (44.9 – 13.1) × 0.6 
= 137.3 dB

perpendicular street to the location of the BS. The distances of the BS and MS to the corner 
of the street are 20 and 30 meters, respectively. The base station height is 20m.


Solution:

= 1.8 GHz (0.9 to 2 GHz)  
The effective transmitter (base station) antenna height, hb  = 20m 
T-R separation distance, d = √(202 + 302)    
From Okumura-Hata Model we know,

 A hexagonal cell within a 4-cell system has a radius of 1.387 km. A total of 
60 channels are used within the entire system. If the load per user is 0.029 Erlangs, and λ= 
call/hour, compute the following for an Erlang C system that has a 5% probability of a 
delayed call- 
a) How many users per square kilometer will this system support? 
b) What is the probability that a delayed call will have to wait for more than 10s? 
c) What is the probability that a call will be delayed for more than 10 seconds? 


Solution: 
Have given,  
Cell radius, R       
Area covered per cell is 2.598 x (1.387)2  
Number of cells per cluster,n    
Total number of channels, N     
Therefore, number of channels per cell = 60 / 4  
= 1.387 km  
≈ 5 sq km  
= 4  
= 60  
= 15 channels. 
From Erlang C chart, for 5% probability of delay with C = 15,  
Traffic intensity, A     
= 9.0 Erlangs. 
(a) 
Have given,  
Traffic per user, Au = 0.029 Erlangs. 
We know, 
The number of users, U    
= A / Au 
= 9.0/0.029  
= 310 users  
The number of users per square km = 310 users /5 sq km  
= 62 users /sq km  
(b) 
Have given,  
Wave length, 𝜆  
Holding time, H  
Time, t   
= 1 call/hour 
= Au / 𝜆  
= 0.029 hour 
= 104.4 seconds. 
= 10s 

We know,  
The conditional probability that a delayed call will have to wait for more than t 
seconds is Pr[delay > t | delay] = exp(-(C-A)t/H)  
      = exp (-(15-9)10/104.4) 
      = 56.29 % 
(c) 
Have given,  
The probability of delayed call, Pr[delay > 0]  = 5 % = 0.05 
We know,  
Probability that a call is delayed more than 10 seconds,  
Pr[delay > 10] = Pr[delay > 0] × Pr[delay > t | delay] 
    = 0.05 × 0.5629 
    = 2.81 %
